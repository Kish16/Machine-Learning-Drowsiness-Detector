# Machine-Learning-Drowsiness-Detector
This project is a drowsiness detector I created using YOLO, Pytorch and Python. I trained my model from scratch by feeding it two buckets of images (awake and drowsy) that I took of myself. The main application for this program would be to identify when drivers are tired and to alert them in order to keep roads safe.
